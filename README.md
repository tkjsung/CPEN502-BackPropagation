## About This Repository

This is one out of the two repositories I have on this course. This repository contains code for backpropagation, trained using XOR dataset (four dataset combinations per each training epoch).

Because this course project utilizes the programming game, [Robocode](https://robocode.sourceforge.io), all code has been written in Java to enable future use of the code I have written.
